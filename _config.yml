  Hi! My name is Oliver and I'm a senior at <strong>Amherst College</strong> double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics.
  Iâ€™m originally from Evanston, Illinois but recently moved to New Orleans.
  I'm especially interested in interactive data visualizations and evolutionary computation.
  Outside of that, I enjoy photography, playing the piano, and rock climbing.
