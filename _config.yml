  Hi! My name is Oliver and I'm a senior at <strong>Amherst College</strong> double majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Statistics</strong>.
  Iâ€™m originally from Evanston, Illinois but recently moved to New Orleans.
  I'm especially interested in  <strong>interactive data visualizations</strong> and  <strong>evolutionary computation</strong>.
  Outside of that, I enjoy photography, playing the piano, and rock climbing.
