#### [Ring of Fire: Evolving a Wildfire Simulator using Genetic Programming](https://github.com/Oliver-BE/ring-of-fire)

A **parallelized genetic program** for evolving rules that describe a cellular automaton based wildfire simulation. Both the genetic program and the wildfire simulator were written in **Clojure** by [@icaruso21](https://github.com/icaruso21), [@MGlusker](https://github.com/MGlusker), and myself.

### Data Visualizations 

#### [Interactive Directed Graph Creator](https://oliver-be.ml/interactive-directed-graph-creator/)

A fully interactive web app for creating directed graphs using **D3**'s force layout. This was built as a prototype for a [state chart](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/uml/uml_statechart_diagram.html) as part of the work I did as a research assistant for the [Tulane Visualization and Graphics Group](https://tulanevisgraphics.bitbucket.io/).
